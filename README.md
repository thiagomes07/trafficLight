# trafficLight
This Arduino code creates a traffic light system using a `Semaforo` class to control red, yellow, and green LEDs, a button, a potentiometer, and a buzzer. The potentiometer adjusts light durations, the button modifies red and green times, and the buzzer signals transitions. State changes are displayed on the Serial Monitor.
